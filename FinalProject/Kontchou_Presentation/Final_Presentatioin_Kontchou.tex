\frametitle{What is the UFC?}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) was created in 1993 to to identify the most effective martial art in a contest.
  \item Was the between competitors of different fighting disciplines like boxing, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Sambo, wrestling, Muay Thai, karate, judo, ect.
  \item UFC has grown to the world's leading mixed martial arts (MMA) promotion company, putting on the most events in the industry by a large margin.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What data did I use?}
\begin{itemize}
  \item An MMA and data science enthusiast, Jian Qiao, scraped the data from sherdog.com
  \item Two data sets: Fights and Fighters
  \item The two data sets used for this 390 events and 4058 matches has been held around the globe
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Problems with the data}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Needed some cleaning and wrangling
    \item Does not include events after 2/4/17. 44 fights and over 100 debuting fighters
    \item UFC has absorbed other MMA promotions like StrikeForce and Pride MMA
    \item Overwhelming majority of fighters do not spend entire career UFC.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What questions am I looking to answer?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Who is the greatest fighter of all-time?
\item What is the distribution of the different methods of victory?
\item How does age affect success in the UFC?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What methods did I use?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Merged the two data sets by number of fights and wins to get win percentage for each fighter
    \item Used Emperical Bayes Estimation to adjust for fighters with very few fights and win percentages of 0 or 1
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What methods did I use?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Merged two data sets by method of victory to get show the distribution of different methods.
    \item Did the same for each individual weight class
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What methods did I use?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Merged two data sets by the birth date of each fighter to get an age for each fighter.
    \item Subtracted the date of the event by the birth date of each fighter to get a "FightingAge" variable
    \item Used FightingAge to get distribution of number of wins of UFC fights by age of UFC fighters and create a graph that measures success with age.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\frametitle{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
  \item There is room for argument in the top 3, but Jon Jones has the edge as the GOAT.
  \item Most fights in the UFC are taken by fighters in their late 20s and early 30s, which indicates that the UFC is a destination that fighters are building their careers towards.
  \item Win rate declines with age, which says something about youth vs. experience. 
\end{itemize}
