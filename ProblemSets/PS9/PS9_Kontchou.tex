\section{ANSWER TO (5)}
\textbf{Generally the dimensionality of the problem is equal to the number of inputs, which is 14}

\section{ANSWER TO (6)}
\textbf{The optimal value of lambda is 0.00137. The in-sample RMSE is 0.1428069. The out-of-sample RMSE is 0.1796624.}

\section{ANSWER TO (7)}
\textbf{The optimal value of lambda is 0.0459. The in-sample RMSE is 0.1427833. The out-of-sample RMSE is 0.1578589.}

\section{ANSWER TO (8)}
\textbf{The optimal value of lambda is 0.000479. The optimal value of alpha=0.578. The in-sample RMSE is 0.1406459. The out-of-sample RMSE is 0.1813920. The optimal value for alpha found in the net elastic model is closer to the value found in the ridge regression.}
