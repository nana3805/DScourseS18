\section{Reason for Choosing this Data}

\textbf{I'm interested in the difference in GDP between the African countries. There seems to be an upper class made up of the top 3 countries, in terms of GDP ranking, then the GDPs fall off a cliff. There is not a strong middle class, which is the case in all of these African countries as well.} 

\textbf{
I plan on using this data on my research project. I tried to use different online tutorials like "Scraping Web Data in R - Rvest Tutorial" on YouTube. But the driving factor was visiting your office and having you walk me through the process.}

\textbf{I also used the World Bank API to scrape some data about Cameroon. I want to use this data in my research project as well. I used the code "tvganesh" put on github to get some information on fertility rates, electricity consumption, and gdp growth}
